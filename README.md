## üîÑ LangGraph Workflow

The DeepAgent Financial Systems operates through a structured LangGraph workflow to process financial queries. This sequential process ensures a systematic approach from understanding the user's request to executing the analysis and providing insights.

```mermaid
graph TD
    start_node((_start_)) --> determine_type_node[determine_type]
    determine_type_node --> create_plan_node[create_plan]
    create_plan_node --> execute_analysis_node[execute_analysis]
    execute_analysis_node --> end_node((_end_))
```

**Workflow Steps:**
1. **_start_**: Initiates the financial analysis process
2. **determine_type**: Analyzes the user's query to identify the specific type of financial analysis required (e.g., stock price, historical data, portfolio analysis)
3. **create_plan**: Develops a detailed plan for executing the identified analysis, outlining the necessary steps and tools
4. **execute_analysis**: Executes the plan using specialized financial tools and OpenAI models to retrieve and process real market data
5. **_end_**: Concludes the workflow, providing the final analysis or insights to the user
